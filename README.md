## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In this machine learning project, I aim to analyze and cluster vowel formant frequencies using the Peterson and Barney's dataset. The dataset contains measurements of the fundamental frequency (F0) and the first three formant frequencies (F1-F3) of sustained English vowels. I will focus on the formant frequencies F1 and F2 to explore unsupervised learning techniques. Specifically, I will apply the Mixture of Gaussians model and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to cluster the vowel formants and discover underlying patterns in the data.

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
* Load the Peterson and Barney's dataset, focusing on the F1 and F2 formant frequencies.
* Analyze the dataset's structure, including the number of instances and the dimensionality of the formant frequencies.
* Preprocess the data, if necessary, by normalizing or scaling the features.
* Visualize the data using scatter plots or other relevant visualizations to gain insights into the distributions and potential clusters.

### Mixture of Gaussians (MoG):
* Understand the Mixture of Gaussians model, which assumes that the data is generated from a combination of Gaussian distributions.
* Apply the MoG model to the vowel formant frequencies, with the goal of clustering the data into distinct groups.
* Initialize the model parameters, including the number of components (clusters), means, covariance matrices, and mixing coefficients.
* Implement the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and optimize the likelihood.
* Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
  
### Clustering and Visualization:
* Assign each data point to the most probable cluster based on the learned MoG model.
* Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots or other appropriate visualizations.
* Analyze the cluster assignments and interpret the patterns discovered in the vowel formant frequencies.
* Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
* Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using metrics like silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares.
* Assess the stability and robustness of the clusters by performing sensitivity analysis or considering multiple random initializations.
* Interpret the clusters in terms of the phoneme_id labels and analyze the relationships between the clusters and the ground truth classes.
* Discuss the findings and insights obtained from the clustering analysis, relating them to the characteristics of vowel formant frequencies.

### Conclusion:
This project focused on clustering vowel formant frequencies using the Mixture of Gaussians model and the EM algorithm. By applying unsupervised learning techniques, we successfully identified clusters and patterns in the vowel data. The results contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between formant frequencies and phoneme classifications. This knowledge can have applications in various fields, such as speech recognition, phonetics, and linguistics.
